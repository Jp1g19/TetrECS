<h1 align="center">Coursework project for programming module</h1>

The game is an adaptation of the popular game called Tetris created with JavaFX. With new and altered blocks, a multiplayer mode based on local hosted games aswell as local and online highscores, this project was created by myself based on a raw template provided for the coursework.
